        <h2>What is JS?</h2>         

        <p><strong>JavaScript</strong>, often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>,
        is a programming language that is one of the core technologies 
        of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
        <br>As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, 
        often incorporating third-party libraries. 
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
        
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language 
        that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
        It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
        It has application programming interfaces (APIs) 
        for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, 
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
