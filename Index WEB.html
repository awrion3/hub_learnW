        <h2>What is WEB?</h2>            

        <p><strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system 
        enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.
        <br>Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers 
        and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. 
        Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified 
        and located through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).</p>
        
        <p>The original and still very common document type is a web page 
        formatted in <u>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</u>. 
        This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, 
        and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. 
        The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) 
        which provide immediate access to other web resources.</p>
